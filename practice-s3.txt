 What happens when : 

a) Create bucket ->Enable versioning -> suspend versioning -> upload a object -> delete the object -> can you bring the object back?
b) Create bucket -> enable versioning -> upload object (file1) -> suspend versioning -> upload object (file2) -> delete file 2 -> can you bring the 
file2 back?
c) Create bucket -> enable versioning -> upload object (file1) -> suspend versioning -> upload object (file2) -> delete file 1 -> can you bring the 
file1 back?
d) Create bucket -> upload object (file1) -> enable versioning -> upload object (file2) -> delete file1 -> can you bring the file1 back?
e) Create bucket -> upload object (file1) -> enable versioning -> upload object (file2) -> delete file2 -> can you bring file2 back?
f) Create bucket  -> upload object (file1) -> enable versiong -> upload object (file2) -> Suspend versioning -> Delete file1 -> Can you bring file1 back??
g) Create bucket  -> upload object (file1) -> enable versiong -> upload object (file2) -> Suspend versioning -> Delete file2 -> Can you bring file2 back??
h) Create bucket -> Enable versioning -> upload object (file1) -> suspend versioning -> upload file2 -> Enable versioning -> upload file 3 
-> suspend versionnig-> delete file 1->can you bring back file1
i)Create bucket -> Enable versioning -> upload object (file1) -> suspend versioning -> upload file2 -> Enable versioning -> upload file 3 
-> suspend versionnig-> delete file2->can you bring back file2
j) Create bucket -> Enable versioning -> upload object (file1) -> suspend versioning -> upload file2 -> Enable versioning -> upload file 3 
-> suspend versionnig-> delete file3->can you bring back file3


21) Create a bucket -> make s3 bucket public -> upload object -> make the object as public -> now change the object back to private
22) Is it necessary to delete the content of S3 bucket to delete a S3 bucket? how can you delete a S3 bucket

24) Demonstrate CRR(cross region replication) in s3 in which source bucket is in northvirginia and the destination bucket is in mumbai
25) what happens if you change your source bucket to private and destination bucket as private? still CRR will work?
26) what happens if you change your source bucket to public and destination bucket as private ? still CRR will work?
27) what happens if you change your source bucket to public and destination bucket as public? still CRR will work?
28) What happens if you change the object in source bucket to public? will it be changed to public in destination bucket also?
29) What happens if you change the object in source bucket to private ?will it be changed to private in destination bucket also or will not change anything?

31) what happens when you delete the object from the source bucket? would it be deleted in destination bucket also?
32) what happens when you delete the object from the destination bucket? would it be deleted in source bucket also?
